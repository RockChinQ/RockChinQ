<h2>🐾 &nbsp;Stories </h2>
Born in 2002,following my father(he loves computer programming when he was young),I fell in love with computer world at my childhood.  
In the 00's,I sat on his leg seeing he using computer,sometimes click the little lion(of the Rising anti-virus soft) on screen,feeling so funny.  
Started playing Minecraft at about four grade of primary school,and tried to use Blocklauncher to load plugins for Minecraft,then tried to write plugins 1 year later.  
It was JavaScript used to write plugins for Minecraft Pocket Edition.For the name of this language,I tried to learn Java when I was six grade when I was 11 or 12 years old.  
Uhhh,though Java is not easy for me at that time,I have learnt to write some tiny-but-funny programs.  
  
Go through my middle school with my video-editing hobby,that girl and Java( and my study,which got me to a pretty good high school).  
But until the second year of my high school,I even didn't know how to use Socket(lol..).  
At the end of the June of 2020,I and my friend Soulter(https://github.com/Soulter) made a software for a activity hold by the Students' Union.  
This is my first time to use Socket.  
As the saying goes,"Every computer player wants to be a hacker"(said by me),I started GhostJ project(https://github.com/RockChinQ/GhostJ) to try to control computers in my campus.  
And I made it.  
After about one and a half years,I can now use Java more skilled.  

Knowledge is a circle,you know that you know so little only when you knew more.  

So I'm still learning.
